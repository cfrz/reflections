you create a .git file that keeps track of all the files needed for a git repo

the staging area is where you prepare files to be committed. it is not a repository
it is only a partial snapshot of your working directory - that would be all the files

you can find the difference between files in the staging area and ensure only one
logical change per commit has been made.
