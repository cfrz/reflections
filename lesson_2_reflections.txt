you create a .git file that keeps track of all the files needed for a git repo

the staging area is where you prepare files to be committed. it is not a repository
it is only a partial snapshot of your working directory - that would be all the files

you can find the difference between files in the staging area and ensure only one
logical change per commit has been made. 

branches are useful when you want to try new things, or make different versions
of the master branch. this allows you to keep a working version rather than
overwriting the master branch with changes that may not work
