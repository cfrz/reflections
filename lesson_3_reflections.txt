keeping a cloud based repository allows you to use multiple computers to work on files,
allows you to collaborate with others on your project

you would not want to pull automatically in case you do not want to accept changes to 
your branch. a collaborator may not have made changes you intend to add to your master

fork - when you want to use someone else's repo and give that dev credit. This just copies
their work same as cloning would.

clone - when you want to clone a repository, but you either have permission or access
to do that

branch - a branch is when you already have the repository and you want to make changes
that are beyond what has been currently developed
