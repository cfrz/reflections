viewing the diff between 2 files let me zero in on what lines had the bug,
and let me easily spot differences

easy access to version control will allow you to find the differences between working 
and non-working files, possibly illuminating bugs

some version control systems use multi file commits because files are connected in
such a way that ensure you have compatible versions of each file. otherwise they
wouldn't work
